This approach allows for the introduction of:</p><ul><li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Each ticket is unique, and its history (issuance, ownership transfers) is traceable on-chain.</li><li><strong>Control:</strong> Rules can be implemented directly in the ticket&rsquo;s smart contract or the marketplace to limit unfair practices.</li><li><strong>New Possibilities:</strong> NFTs open doors to additional experiences for fans (digital collectibles, exclusive content, loyalty mechanisms).</li></ul><h3 id=the-mvp-minimum-viable-product>The MVP (Minimum Viable Product)</h3><p>I have developed a working <strong>MVP (Minimum Viable Product) / Demo</strong> that demonstrates the core functionalities:</p><ol><li><strong>Primary Sale (Minting):</strong> Issuing NFT tickets associated with specific events.</li><li><strong>P2P Secondary Marketplace:</strong> A platform where users can resell their NFT tickets to other users.</li><li><strong>Anti-Scalping Mechanism:</strong> Implementation of a <strong>price cap</strong> in the secondary marketplace to prevent resale at prices higher than the original.</li><li><strong>Wallet Management:</strong> Support for both internally managed wallets (hybrid custodial) and connecting external wallets (e.g., MetaMask).</li></ol><h3 id=technology-stack-overview>Technology Stack (Overview)</h3><p>The project is structured as a <strong>monorepo</strong> and uses:</p><ul><li><strong>Smart Contracts:</strong> Solidity (ERC721 standard) with the Hardhat framework on Polygon Amoy.</li><li><strong>Backend:</strong> REST API built with Node.js and Express, interacts with the blockchain via Ethers.js and manages a PostgreSQL database as an off-chain cache.</li><li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Single Page Application developed with Vue.js 3 and Vite, using Pinia for state management and Axios for API calls.</li></ul><h3 id=current-status-and-code>Current Status and Code</h3><p>The MVP demonstrates the technical feasibility of the concept. Development is ongoing, focusing on integrating payment flows and full support for external wallets.</p><p>The complete source code is publicly available on GitHub:
