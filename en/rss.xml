This approach allows for the introduction of:</p><ul><li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Each ticket is unique, and its history (issuance, ownership transfers) is traceable on-chain.</li><li><strong>Control:</strong> Rules can be implemented directly in the ticket&rsquo;s smart contract or the marketplace to limit unfair practices.</li><li><strong>New Possibilities:</strong> NFTs open doors to additional experiences for fans (digital collectibles, exclusive content, loyalty mechanisms).</li></ul><h3 id=the-mvp-minimum-viable-product>The MVP (Minimum Viable Product)</h3><p>I have developed a working <strong>MVP (Minimum Viable Product) / Demo</strong> that demonstrates the core functionalities:</p><ol><li><strong>Primary Sale (Minting):</strong> Issuing NFT tickets associated with specific events.</li><li><strong>P2P Secondary Marketplace:</strong> A platform where users can resell their NFT tickets to other users.</li><li><strong>Anti-Scalping Mechanism:</strong> Implementation of a <strong>price cap</strong> in the secondary marketplace to prevent resale at prices higher than the original.</li><li><strong>Wallet Management:</strong> Support for both internally managed wallets (hybrid custodial) and connecting external wallets (e.g., MetaMask).</li></ol><h3 id=technology-stack-overview>Technology Stack (Overview)</h3><p>The project is structured as a <strong>monorepo</strong> and uses:</p><ul><li><strong>Smart Contracts:</strong> Solidity (ERC721 standard) with the Hardhat framework on Polygon Amoy.</li><li><strong>Backend:</strong> REST API built with Node.js and Express, interacts with the blockchain via Ethers.js and manages a PostgreSQL database as an off-chain cache.</li><li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Single Page Application developed with Vue.js 3 and Vite, using Pinia for state management and Axios for API calls.</li></ul><h3 id=current-status-and-code>Current Status and Code</h3><p>The MVP demonstrates the technical feasibility of the concept. Development is ongoing, focusing on integrating payment flows and full support for external wallets.</p><p>The complete source code is publicly available on GitHub:

Maybe as &ldquo;<strong>an eternally curious, pragmatic creative</strong>&rdquo;. Or perhaps, a <strong>marketing graduate</strong> who has a blast &ldquo;getting his hands dirty&rdquo; with <strong>technology</strong> and <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> to understand how things work and, above all, to build something new.</p><p>Welcome to my digital space: a mix of portfolio, scattered notes, and ongoing projects.</p><h3 id=the-mix-marketing-data--code>The Mix: Marketing, Data & Code</h3><p>Technology and science have always fascinated me. <strong><code>Even as a kid, this curiosity led me to tinker with early programming languages (C, Python, HTML), manage small online game servers (Habbo, Metin2), learning the basics of systems like FreeBSD, and actively moderate online communities and forums.</code></strong> Then life led me to consider computer science, physics, even literature&mldr; finally landing on <strong>Economics and Marketing</strong> at the University of Parma (first Bachelor&rsquo;s, then Master&rsquo;s in Trade and Consumer Marketing). I am also fluent in <strong>English (C1 level)</strong>. Why this path? Because in marketing, I saw a fascinating <strong>intersection of disciplines</strong>: not just economics and psychology, but also communication, data, art, and, increasingly, technology and code. It&rsquo;s precisely this mix that stimulates me.</p><p>I am passionate about applying a <strong>data-driven approach</strong> and experimenting with <strong>AI</strong> to make campaigns and strategies more effective, particularly in Digital Advertising and Performance Marketing (where I recently obtained Google Ads and Analytics certifications). And I don&rsquo;t stop at theory: I like to build websites, web apps, and digital projects myself, often using AI to explore new possibilities.</p><h3 id=in-the-works-current-projects-and-ambitions>In the Works: Current Projects and Ambitions</h3><p>My philosophy is &ldquo;Okay, cool&mldr; <strong>but what if we tried doing it like this?</strong>&rdquo;. This drive leads me to explore and build continuously. Currently, my main focuses are:</p><ul><li><strong>AMPHI:</strong> I&rsquo;m working on <a href=https://modernage12.github.io/lorenzosnotes/lorenzosnotes/en/progetti/amphi/><strong>AMPHI</strong></a>
, an <strong>NFT ticketing platform on the blockchain</strong>. The idea is to use technology to combat bots and secondary ticketing, giving more power, transparency, and value to artists and fans. A complex but fascinating challenge. <em>(I talk more about it in the Projects section)</em>.</li><li><strong>Trading:</strong> An interest born during university that I cultivate as a self-learner. I&rsquo;m refining my strategy with the goal of passing prop firm challenges and achieving <strong>independence as a professional trader</strong>.</li><li><strong>Marketing in the Field:</strong> The goal is to gain direct experience in operational marketing (ideally in performance/advertising), with the dream of <strong>opening an agency</strong>.</li></ul><h3 id=the-method-pragmatic-creativity>The &ldquo;Method&rdquo;: Pragmatic Creativity</h3><p>At the core of everything is the desire to <strong>create</strong>, to <strong>be independent</strong>, to discover, experiment, and question. <strong><code>This attitude has materialized in the past in projects like digital community radios and e-commerce experiments, and continues today with the challenges of AMPHI and beyond (you can find several examples among my</code></strong> <a href=https://modernage12.github.io/lorenzosnotes/lorenzosnotes/en/progetti/><strong>Projects</strong></a>
<strong><code>)</code></strong>. I define myself as a <strong>creative</strong>, but with my feet on the ground: I like thinking outside the box, but also analyzing results and making things work (the pragmatic side!). And I don&rsquo;t give up easily.</p><h3 id=beyond-the-screen>Beyond the Screen</h3><p>And when I step away from the PC, strategies, and charts? There&rsquo;s <strong>Music</strong>. It&rsquo;s the foundation, a fundamental constant. I started (with no experience) playing bass in a high school band, then continued playing in new bands, starting new projects, and experimenting with new genres, also recording demos, albums, and EPs. I&rsquo;m fascinated by the world of production, especially electronic. A path I hope to delve into soon.</p><p>Since I believe the music a person listens to says a lot about them, in the button below or here you can find my <a href=https://open.spotify.com/user/8231spvupmlhz640983icnslg rel=external><strong>Spotify</strong></a>
