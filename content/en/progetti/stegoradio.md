**stegoradio** was a collaborative project born with the aim of creating an **online radio and a community for emerging artists** in Salento (Southern Italy).

### Objective and Challenges
We wanted to give visibility to local talents and create a gathering space, all with an almost non-existent budget. The main challenge was building awareness and engagement from scratch.

### Strategy and Actions
We focused heavily on **Content Marketing** and **Social Media** management, particularly Instagram. Key activities included:
* Production of original content: **Podcasts**, video and written **interviews**, interactive formats.
* Field activities: Conducting **video interviews** on the streets of Lecce.
* Community Management: Constant interaction on Instagram, Telegram, and Discord.
* Event Presence: We secured **sponsorship for a university event** in Lecce, which allowed us to increase visibility.
* Website & YouTube Channel Development.

### Results and Learnings
Despite limited resources, we managed to:
* Build an **active and interested community**.
* Achieve **significant organic growth** on the Instagram page (around 250 followers).
* Gain local recognition (invitation/sponsorship for the event).
* **Key Learning:** I learned firsthand how to develop an effective content marketing strategy on a tight budget, manage social channels for organic growth and engagement, and the importance of community building.

*(In parallel, the idea for steghold, an NFT/ticketing marketplace, was born but later shelved due to complexity).*
