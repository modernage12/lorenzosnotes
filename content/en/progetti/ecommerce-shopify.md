During my master's degree period, I started a **personal e-commerce project** focused on the **home automation** sector, with the primary goal of **learning concretely** how to use digital marketing tools and manage an online store.

### Objective and Context
The purpose was not primarily sales, but **"getting my hands dirty"** with practice, having a **very limited budget** as a student living away from home. I chose the **Shopify** platform for its completeness and widespread use.

### Activities Carried Out
* Creation and configuration of the Shopify store.
* Definition of the marketing and product strategy.
* Implementation and management of **Digital Advertising campaigns on Meta Ads and Google Ads**.
* Performance monitoring via **Google Analytics** and **KPI** analysis.
* Optimization attempts through **A/B testing** and continuous campaign adjustments.

### Results and Learnings
* I gained **direct practical experience** with fundamental tools (Shopify, Google Ads, Meta Ads, GA).
* I learned to manage campaigns with reduced budgets, focusing on optimization.
* I came **close to the first sale**, lost only due to an error in configuring shipping costs (an important lesson learned!).
* The experiment **achieved the learning objective**, providing me with solid practical foundations in performance marketing and e-commerce management.
