**polka clothing** started as a fun little experiment in **micro-entrepreneurship** and **branding** in the world of **vintage clothing reselling**, conducted with a friend.

### The Idea
We bought unique clothing items at flea markets and resold them on the **Vinted** platform. The goal was not just to sell, but to create a small, recognizable brand and offer a quality experience.

### Branding and Marketing
We created the "**polka clothing**" brand from scratch, defining:
* A **style** and a coordinated image.
* A specific **tone of voice** for communication.
* A dedicated **Instagram page** ([**@polka_clothing**](https://www.instagram.com/polka_clothing/)) to showcase items and interact.

### Customer Experience
Particular attention was paid to the post-purchase experience, taking care of the **packaging** and adding small details like personalized **candies and thank-you notes**.

### Result
Despite being a small-scale project ("small satisfactions"), polka clothing was a formative and fun experience that allowed us to concretely apply principles of branding, social media marketing, e-commerce, and customer care in a real context.
