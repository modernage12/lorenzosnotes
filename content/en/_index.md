## Welcome to my Digital Space!

Hi, I'm Lorenzo. This site is my online "notebook" where I collect and share projects I work on, technologies I explore, and personal reflections.

The goal is to create a more complete portrait of myself, going beyond a simple CV.

**Where to start?**

* Check out my **[Projects](/lorenzosnotes/en/progetti/)** to see what I'm building.
* Find out a bit more about **[Who I Am](/lorenzosnotes/en/about/)**.

Feel free to use the menu above to navigate through the different sections. Happy exploring!
