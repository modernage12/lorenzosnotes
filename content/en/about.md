## Hi, I'm Lorenzo! ðŸ‘‹

If I had to sum myself up? Maybe as "**an eternally curious, pragmatic creative**". Or perhaps, a **marketing graduate** who has a blast "getting his hands dirty" with **technology** and **artificial intelligence** to understand how things work and, above all, to build something new.

Welcome to my digital space: a mix of portfolio, scattered notes, and ongoing projects.

### The Mix: Marketing, Data & Code

Technology and science have always fascinated me. **`Even as a kid, this curiosity led me to tinker with early programming languages (C, Python, HTML), manage small online game servers (Habbo, Metin2), learning the basics of systems like FreeBSD, and actively moderate online communities and forums.`** Then life led me to consider computer science, physics, even literature... finally landing on **Economics and Marketing** at the University of Parma (first Bachelor's, then Master's in Trade and Consumer Marketing). I am also fluent in **English (C1 level)**. Why this path? Because in marketing, I saw a fascinating **intersection of disciplines**: not just economics and psychology, but also communication, data, art, and, increasingly, technology and code. It's precisely this mix that stimulates me.

I am passionate about applying a **data-driven approach** and experimenting with **AI** to make campaigns and strategies more effective, particularly in Digital Advertising and Performance Marketing (where I recently obtained Google Ads and Analytics certifications). And I don't stop at theory: I like to build websites, web apps, and digital projects myself, often using AI to explore new possibilities.

### In the Works: Current Projects and Ambitions

My philosophy is "Okay, cool... **but what if we tried doing it like this?**". This drive leads me to explore and build continuously. Currently, my main focuses are:

* **AMPHI:** I'm working on [**AMPHI**](/lorenzosnotes/en/progetti/amphi/), an **NFT ticketing platform on the blockchain**. The idea is to use technology to combat bots and secondary ticketing, giving more power, transparency, and value to artists and fans. A complex but fascinating challenge. *(I talk more about it in the Projects section)*.
* **Trading:** An interest born during university that I cultivate as a self-learner. I'm refining my strategy with the goal of passing prop firm challenges and achieving **independence as a professional trader**.
* **Marketing in the Field:** The goal is to gain direct experience in operational marketing (ideally in performance/advertising), with the dream of **opening an agency**.

### The "Method": Pragmatic Creativity

At the core of everything is the desire to **create**, to **be independent**, to discover, experiment, and question. **`This attitude has materialized in the past in projects like digital community radios and e-commerce experiments, and continues today with the challenges of AMPHI and beyond (you can find several examples among my`** [**Projects**](/lorenzosnotes/en/progetti/) **`)`**. I define myself as a **creative**, but with my feet on the ground: I like thinking outside the box, but also analyzing results and making things work (the pragmatic side!). And I don't give up easily.

### Beyond the Screen

And when I step away from the PC, strategies, and charts? There's **Music**. It's the foundation, a fundamental constant. I started (with no experience) playing bass in a high school band, then continued playing in new bands, starting new projects, and experimenting with new genres, also recording demos, albums, and EPs. I'm fascinated by the world of production, especially electronic. A path I hope to delve into soon.

Since I believe the music a person listens to says a lot about them, in the button below or here you can find my [**Spotify**](https://open.spotify.com/user/8231spvupmlhz640983icnslg) profile.
