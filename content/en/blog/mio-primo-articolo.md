This is officially the first article of my new personal blog.

I've been thinking for a while about opening a space to share more structured thoughts compared to a social media post.

## What Will I Talk About?

Mainly about:
* Marketing and Strategy
* Practical applications of AI
* Tools and Technologies I discover and find interesting
* Reflections on learning, readings, etc.
* (Maybe) Trading
* Ideas, future projects, etc.

I hope you find something useful or interesting!
